## Reading

This Politico article contains several quotes by CUSP Prof Julia Lane. 
[Is Washington Bungling the Census?](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/11/federal-data-collection-in-crisis-000537)

This article is politically charged. Generally I strive to give you impartial, non-political views on topics, but I could not find a more impartial paper on the issues the census is undergoing. Yet I think the census data is extremely important for you as urban scientist so you should pay attention to this.

Also if you are interested (but not mandatory):
[Historians and the Census: the Historiography of
Census Research](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9478&context=annals-of-iowa)




## Assignment 1: census geospatial analysis. 
## Due in two weeks, the week after thanksgiving. Work in groups.

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/) data (really the 1-year survey data) and at the same time to make you exercise with spatial analysis in geopandas.
The goal is to assess if the [linkNYC](https://www.link.nyc/) stations are located to provide a useful service and to fill in a need. You will work with the American Fact Finder data via API and direct download, and with NYC shapefiles.
The homework is long but you have 2 weeks to do it. If you leave it to the last minute you may have a hard time!
