# Submission Info:

Work in groups as usal, and you are encouraged to work in groups. Create a HW11_ directory in your PUI2016_ repository. Include a README.md that briefly summarizes the scope of the homework (so we know you understand what you did), and states with whome you worked and what you specifically contributed to.

Submit Assignment as notebooks. Please dont just download my notebook, leave instructions in and fill in code cells: make it a presentation, comment on what you see, in English, with full sentences, and use critical thinking!!

Keep in mind that we will look for possible cases of plagiarism, and if the code appears too similar to that of people that you did not work with to be original work (there are automated ways to look for plagiarism in code) you will be penalized.


**Assignment 1.** 

Find periodicity with Fourier Transforms in the time series from [HW11](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/tree/master/HW11_fb55). Comment on what you find: what are the most significant periods? Follow instructions in [notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW12_fb55/subway_timeseries_instructions_part2.ipynb)

**Assignment 2.**

Cluster zipcodes based on the economic development (business counts) in time for 1993-2006
Clustering often takes time, particularly hierarchical clustering. Dont start at the last minute!
Comment on patterns you see: which zipcodes have similar time evolution in the number of businesses? what are peculiar the characteristics in the economic evolution of each cluster ? upward trends, downward trends, inflection points, discontinuities?
